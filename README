elf.js: A (very simple) ELF parser in JavaScript.

Relies heavily on typed arrays, as well as:
https://github.com/davidflanagan/BufferView
and DataView, or:
https://github.com/davidflanagan/DataView.js
and:
https://github.com/luser/uint64.js

Usage:
  var elf = new ELF(buffer);
where |arraybuffer| is an ArrayBuffer containing the bytes of the ELF file.
